# django_nukedb
Exercise the nuclear option with ease


Why bother with migrations during development? It's much easier to wipe out the
database and start over ever time you change the data model. This Django Management
commands will drop the database, wipe out any existing migration files, and run
additional management commands (i.e. data factories to repopulate the database).

There's no better way to write code than with tactical nuclear weapons.
